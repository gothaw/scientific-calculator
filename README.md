# scientific-calculator
Scientific calculator written in JavaScript utilizing shunting yard algorithm and reverse polish notation

The input-stack.js file generates infix equation as an array. The infix notation is changed to postfix in shunting-yard.js using shunting-yard algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm#The_algorithm_in_detail). The value of postfix equation is calculated in rpn.js using reverse polish notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Postfix_evaluation_algorithm)
